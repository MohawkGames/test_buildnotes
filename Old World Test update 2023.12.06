Test Branch: 1.0.69930 Test 12/06/2023

Design
  Competitive mode character yields and modifiers now scale linearly.  Ratings lower than 5 will have higher effects and higher ratings lower effects.
  Character upgrades for leaders, governors, and generals (under retirement age) now include only traits, if possible
  Increased tier of grove luxuries ambition 

Programming
  More logging and a possible fix for remote server disconnections
  Better failure reporting when an EventOption using the new syntax specifies an invalid subject alias
  mapPath now excluded from GameParameters when writing to XML 
  
UI
  Added a generic improvement ping that is used to indicate preferred placement of any improvement
  Improvement pings are less restrictive in checking validity (i.e. can now add improvement pings to Sand that would be valid for Clerics before founding city)
  CTRL-click Heal now automatically heals the unit every turn until fully healed or idle healing would bring unit to full health anyway
  Clergy included in turn summary announcements and notable character list
  Religion changes for unimportant characters no longer shown in turn summary
  Character tooltip always shows heir rank, if any 
  Clergy traits in Encyclopaedia show the related religion
  Added Encyclopedia description for city site improvement 
  Removed "Could lead to future events" link help which was working consistently 
  Added text scaling to reduce overlap on city production menu for some mods
  Added hint about Polytheism to the 8 shrine ambition

  Fixed city selection lighting change bug
  Fixed bug in Heroes of the Aegean scenario with late-game event getting invalidated upon triggering
