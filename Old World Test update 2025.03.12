Test Branch 1.0.76797 Test 2025-03-12

Design

National Ambitions:
The final ambition is now called a National Ambition and may be offered early, after a player has completed 5 ambitions
The offer is triggered soon after the player reaches 75% progress towards one of the national ambitions
National Ambitions are not used for tier counting purposes i.e. they do not make regular ambition offers harder
All National Ambitions are listed in the Encyclopedia under their own category
Added new National Ambition '+250 Food, Iron, Stone, Wood and Money per turn'.  This replaces the previous ambition to stockpile 2000 of each resource
Added new regular Ambition 'Control 4 Hamlet class improvements'
Adjusted ambition threshold calculations and ambition events to allow a greater variety of ambitions to be offered

Continent map script changes:
Continent is now the default map script
Added new Extreme Terrain suboption 'None' and made this the default
Tribal Lands placement option removed

7 new events relating to Calamities happening to other players (Wrath of Gods)
Reduced other religion opinion penalty duration for Venerate mission (Wrath of Gods)
Increased chance of Scrub appearing on new Arid tiles on Ebbing Sea map from 2% to 10% (Wrath of Gods)

Programming

Mod manager no longer fully loads installed maps when fetching subscription info 
Unit XP overflow into training uses TRAINING_PER_XP for consistency
Buildable projects now use a ProductionType such as YIELD_CIVICS. Non-buildable projects do not require this
iCivics has been renamed to iCost in project.xml

UI

Can now queue the same tile multiple times without the unit executing the queued moves
When the last tile in a move queue is right-clicked, the unit executes the queue
Flipped luxury panel buttons 
Tweaked alignment for scenario-specific goal info
Archetypes now shown in line of succession panel
