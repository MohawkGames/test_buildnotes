Test Branch 1.0.76691 Test 2025-03-05

Design

Commander leaders always grant +10XP per turn to all units (previously units had to be idle)
Free improvements are now allowed on resource tiles with a generic improvement ping. Placing a free urban improvement on a resource removes the resource without harvesting it
Stun is now possible when attacking a unit in a city without any HP left
Critical hits on cities are no longer possible 
Events where the AI offers Truce on breaching a city now trigger when the city is captured instead

Programming

Performance improvements
Improved UI responsiveness when cycling through workers
Added ALLOW_CITY_CRITICAL_HITS to globalsInt, for use by modders

UI

Setup screen changes:

Removed Options Preset dropdown from Simple setup and added Event Level
Added Reset Options button to Advanced and MP setup screens
Added difficulty mode to Advanced setup screen
Simple setup settings are saved separately from advanced setup settings. Going back and forth between Advanced and Simple screens retains only nation and dynasty settings

Enabled DLC no longer gets reset every time

Strategic resource icons for unit production shown on city categories when available
Added worker list to tile tooltip when multiple workers are stacked
Selecting a character centers the camera on job-relevant city or unit
Timeline now shows map terrain changes over time
Timeline now shows current revealed-not-visible state for borders when it is set to show the current turn
With a land unit selected, hovering over a water tile in anchor range will show "Must end move on land tile"
Network games are now paused automatically when the game is over
Cannot surrender a multiplayer game if you are the last player remaining
World tile text now shows over city UI
Unworked wonders show Requires Worker text with worker selected
Right-click toggles tab panel menus off if already open

Removed line break from event option tooltips that start goals
Removed 'New Event in Wizard' button from Event Browser
