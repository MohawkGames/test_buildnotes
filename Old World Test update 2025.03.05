Test Branch 1.0.76691 Test 2025-03-05

Design

Commander leaders always grant +10XP per turn to all units (previously units had to be idle)
Placing a free urban improvement on a resource removes the resource without harvesting it, to be consistent with vegetation clearing
Stun is possible when attacking a unit in a city without any HP left
Critical hits on cities are no longer possible 
Events where the AI offers Truce on breaching a city now trigger when the city is captured instead

Programming

Added ALLOW_CITY_CRITICAL_HITS to globalsInt.xml, for use by modders

UI

Setup screen changes:

Removed options preset dropdown from simple setup and added Event Level
Added Reset Options button to Advanced and MP setup screens
Simple setup settings are saved separately from advanced setup settings
Entering the setup screens with a premade map that restricts nation choices stored in the options file will no longer keep that map choice, to ensure all nations are shown


Selecting a character centers the camera on job-relevant city or unit
World tile text now shows over city UI
Unworked wonders show Requires Worker text with worker selected
Removed some of the yield breakdown from the specialist tooltip and added modified total yield
Removed line break from event option tooltips that start goals
Removed 'New Event in Wizard' button from Event Browser
