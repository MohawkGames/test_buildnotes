Test Branch 1.0.76691 Test 2025-03-05

Design

National Ambitions:
The final ambition is now called a National Ambition and may be offered early, after a player has completed 5 ambitions
The offer is triggered soon after the player reaches 75% progress towards one of the national ambitions
National Ambitions do not count for tier counting purposes i.e. they do not make regular ambition offers harder
All National Ambitions are listed in the Encylopedia under their own category
Added new National Ambition - +250 Food, Iron, Stone, Wood and Money per turn.  This replaces the previous ambition to stockpile 2000 of each resource
Added new regular Ambition - Control 4 Hamlets

Launch Offensive changes:
Cannot launch offensive when on cooldown
Offensive effects do not apply to the leader unit
Leader unit goes on new, launched offensive cooldown 
For team games, bonus orders from the offensive go to the unit owners

Commander leaders always grant +10XP per turn to all units (previously units had to be idle)
Free improvements are now allowed on resource tiles with a generic improvement ping. Placing a free urban improvement on a resource removes the resource without harvesting it
Stun is now possible when attacking a unit in a city without any HP left
Critical hits on cities are no longer possible 
Events where the AI offers Truce on breaching a city now trigger when the city is captured instead
Can no longer build roads and improvements in territory of an ally
Water tiles no longer need to be adjacent to land in order to transfer them from one of your cities to another
Units that earn XP past the maximum level convert that XP to training

Programming

Rendering API change: Linux / Steam Deck now default to Vulkan. Windows supports Vulkan with a command-line switch
Improved UI responsiveness when cycling through workers
Performance improvements
AI combat improvements
Improved AI use of Launch Offensive
Improved AI order predictions when planning moves
AI is more aggressive in moving towards enemy cities when at war
AI more likely to place ranged units in forest when defending its territory with a Tactician leader
AI fort building now less common
AI now less eager to build some wonders that are not very useful (e.g. Jebel Barkal without world religion)
Added ALLOW_CITY_CRITICAL_HITS to globalsInt, for use by modders

UI

Setup screen changes:

Removed Options Preset dropdown from Simple setup and added Event Level
Added Reset Options button to Advanced and MP setup screens
Added difficulty mode to Advanced setup screen
Simple setup settings are saved separately from advanced setup settings. Going back and forth between Advanced and Simple screens retains only nation and dynasty settings
Entering the setup screens with a premade map that restricts nation choices stored in the options file will no longer keep that map choice, to ensure all nations are shown
Enabled DLC no longer gets reset every time

Selected characters now appear in the upper right side of the screen and Ambitions in the upper left
Strategic resource icons for unit production shown on city categories when available
Changed all happiness/discontent yield displays to use relevant icon instead of signed text
Added worker list to tile tooltip when multiple workers are stacked
Selecting a character centers the camera on job-relevant city or unit
Resarch UI is now always shown regardless of selection
Added reminder for pillaged tiles
Added ability to hide improvement tooltips by holding CTRL
Timeline now shows map terrain changes over time
Timeline now shows current revealed-not-visible state for borders when it is set to show the current turn
With a land unit selected, hovering over a water tile in anchor range will show "Must end move on land tile"
Network games are now paused automatically when the game is over
Cannot surrender a multiplayer game if you are the last player remaining
World tile text now shows over city UI
Unworked wonders show Requires Worker text with worker selected
Right-click toggles tab panel menus off if already open
Improved unit strength tooltip text
Updated premade map descriptions
Removed some of the yield breakdown from the specialist tooltip and added modified total yield
Removed line break from event option tooltips that start goals
Removed 'New Event in Wizard' button from Event Browser
City links that do not open the city screen now pan the camera to the city when clicked (i.e. tribal raid notifications)
Starting a game using a parameter string no longer updates the options file with the game's settings
Added more promotion and effectUnit information to encyclopedia
Updated Shapur's dynasty description to clarify that Strike applies to melee and ship units (Wonders and Dynasties)
Plague flies only shown on units with the Plagued effect. Plague fog effect is confined to city territory (Wrath of Gods)
Wildfire visual effect is less extreme (Wrath of Gods)
