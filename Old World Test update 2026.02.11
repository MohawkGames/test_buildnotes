Second tier UU bonus cards require a city with Legendary culture
Zealot leader general now performs a Heal action after each kill, instead of being able to Apply Enlist
Fervent (Piye's unique trait) now enables Apply Enlist as a leader general, at a cost of 100 civics (Wonders and Dynasties)

Carthage city founding bonus reduced from 200 to 100 civics
