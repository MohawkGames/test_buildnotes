Test Branch 1.0.81020 Test 2025-12-03

Design

Added Point Symmetry option to MP setup when Mirror Map option is selected. This enables radial mirroring around the map's midpoint, producing a layout symmetric in all directions from the center
Added event for when AI forfeits a city site due to player having attacked the camp more

Programming

AI avoids building Wonders in border cities, and especially in cities that are in danger of being captured 
AI uses disciples to build religious improvements before further spreading the religion, if possible
Pathfinder prefers to keep units hidden, have them occupy good defensive terrain, and avoid marsh, all else being equal
Added support for local storage for persistent scenario data
