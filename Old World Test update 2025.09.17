Test Branch 1.0.79755 Test 2025-09-17

Design

Temporarily hidden units (i.e. Scouts bounced out of Trees) now become visible after 5 turns (or after attacking or moving)
Temporarily hidden units can no longer occupy territory that they would not be able to occupy if not hidden (i.e. foreign territory while at Truce)
Scouts are no longer removed from the map after establishing an Agent Network and instead get a 5 turn cooldown and are hidden for 10 turns
Enlightenment now gives +3 Happiness only for Monks in Monasteries of Religions that have that Theology 
Assault bonus to attack against forts no longer applies when forts give no defensive bonus
Disabled some more ambitions in One City Challenge
Rightful Heir can no longer become Missing, Exiled, Imprisoned or Fugitive
Added ambitions for building Wonders added in Wonders and Dynasties
Delvers have an opinion penalty towards Stewards of the Land.  These traits are now mutually exclusive (Wrath of Gods)

Programming

Performance optimization for trade network recalculations
AI water control improvements and bug fixes

UI

Turn timer changes (MP):
There are now 2 warnings that turn time is running out
First warning triggers at 30 seconds remaining, turns timer text red and plays audio warning
Second warning triggers at 15 seconds remaining, increases timer text size and plays audio warning again
These times are configurable using a mod in globalsInt.xml

Other UI changes:

Improvement helptext and unit build option prereqs take into account tile owner rather than unit owner
Added helptext warning when trying to build Improvement for teammate who doesn't have required Tech 
Improved some luxury trade help text
Yield production graphs also display the total accumulated up until the hovered point (after game is over and for observers)
'Only Show Map Tacks For Worker' option renamed to 'Contextual Map Tacks'. Now shows improvement pings whenever workers, settlers or disciples are selected

Fixed tribal units with a raid target counting towards a tribal camp's defend threshold or raid start threshold
