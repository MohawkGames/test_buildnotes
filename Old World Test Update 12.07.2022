Test Branch: 1.0.64302 Test 12/07/2022

Design
  Free city site location now takes into account distance over land, not distance as the crow flies
  Events which give traits are no longer blocked when a character already has the trait.  They will now give improvements to character ratings instead.
  New mapscript 'Donut' added (this is a work in progress)

Programming
  Significant improvements to AI use of forts
  Improved AI city siege and other combat tactics
  Improved AI unit build selection 
  Improved AI city founding tile choice
  Improved AI exploration with more than one unit
  Improved AI evaluation of city projects
  Improved AI improvement repairing
  Improved AI reinforcements
  Improved AI tile buying
  AI now values discardable techs less
  AI less likely to hire mercenaries that are damaged and/or far away 

UI
  Added look-ahead terrain texture renderer.  This should reduce the instances of terrain briefly appearing at lower quality when moving to the next unit/city. 
  Hotseat games can now be restarted 
  Hotseat games support different languages for each player
  Added Random Resource and Random Element Names buttons to Map Editor
  Map start tiles for set maps can now be defined in mapStartTile.xml.  This allows modded nations to be given set start points on premade maps. 
  Steam Input updates
