Design

Sacred and Profane Clergy rework:
  The Initiate into Clergy mission run by the Head of Religion has been replaced by a new mission Suggest For Clergy.  This is run via the Chancellor and uses the target characters religion
  A limit of 2 Clergy per nation has been added
  Clergy can now also be Courtiers and marriage restrictions have been removed
  Clergy can run the Tutor as Courtier mission (even if they are not a Courtier)
  Clergy give a base bonus of +30 religion opinion, modified by character opinion
  Pagan Clergy have a +40% chance to become the next Head of Religion and World Religion Clergy have a +20% chance
  Pagan Clergy have a new mission Pagan Sacrifices.  This targets a pagan city and has a 75% chance to increase the cities happiness and 25% chance to give an opinion penalty to the religion 
  World Religion Clergy can now act as Agents in cities of their religion
Doubled money income from connected foreign cities  
Competitive mode character yield modifiers due to ratings halved for governors and agents
Event-caused tribal raids will now target the player, even if at Peace or if another foreign city would be a better target

Tweaks to the New Difficulty level - start with an added Militia, increased civics and training per turn
