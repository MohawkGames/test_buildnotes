Design

Tech tree changes:

Moved Free Battering Ram and Exotic Fur cards to Spoked Wheel 
Free Battering Ram, Akkadian Archer and Hoplite card costs brought in line with other nations free level 1 unique unit cards (200 -> 100)
Moved Free Scholar tech card from Forestry to Metaphysics 
Moved Architecture and Vaulting back a tier in the tech tree
Increased the cost of all 7th tier techs to compensate for the reduction in cost of Architecture and Vaulting (1500 -> 1600)
Architecture requires Drama instead of Portcullis
Portcullis no longer requires Drama
Stirrups requires Portcullis instead of Citizenship
Windlass requires Manor instead of Architecture

Most map scripts in multiplayer now place all human players on the same landmass. 
Exceptions are Archipelago, Continents, Player Islands and Disjunction
This is optional on Mediterranean and Lakes and Gulfs maps using 'Connected Player Starts' as this can significantly affect player starting positions
  
In MP games using the Player Development setting, extra cities have to obey the connection requirements of starting locations. If they can't the player will not get them
Significantly increased the effect of Ruthless AI on player opinion and war declaration modifier 
Laurion Mine now enables a Miner specialist on the tile 
Undo is no longer available in cloud games using the Strict (Teams) turn style.  This does not affect cloud games using Strict (Players) which still have undo.
  

Programming

Improved AI unit danger estimate
AI now helps their allies count down the capture timer for cities 


UI

Added notification for units that you kill during your turn 
City borders now pulse when hovering over the city center
Pin Character mission removed.  Pinning is now performed with a new star icon found under character actions
Leader icon changed to a crown and non-succession royals to an asterisk to differentiate them from the pin icon
Notable characters filter now only shows manually pinned characters and is ordered by turn pinned
Harvested resource tooltip now shows regrow chance as a percentage instead of a die roll 
Family tree toggles now remember their previous state 
Yields are now shown for all agent network cities regardless of agent status when sorting by base yields 
Added support for a more complete set of stats in No Characters mode
Refactored ignore reminders code.  Now supports ignoring reminder types separately for characters with multiple roles
Smaller tech status icons to reduce overlap on mini tech tree
