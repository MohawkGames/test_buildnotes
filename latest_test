Text and event fixes


Notes for modders:

If your mod adds units in unit.xml:
  Add a bRegular flag (after bGeneral in the order) to denote a "regular military" unit. 
  The flag makes the unit count as "regular military" in the stats, and the AI also assumes that non-regular units are worth less.

If your mod adds event links in eventLink.xml:
  aeSubjectClasses is no longer needed
  The link will save all subjects in the triggering event, it will figure out the classes by itself
  If you only want some subjects saved, put iNumSubjects on the link (in eventLink.xml) to save that many subjects
  Put iNumSubjects = 0 if you don't care about any subjects and are only using the link as a shortcut to trigger something else
  For any event links that are meant to be immediate, and are used with EventLinkStart:
    Tag the link with bImmediate = 1 in eventLink.xml
    Use EventLinkAdd in eventOption.xml, as with regular links. EventLinkStart will be removed in the future
