Design
New difficulty level added The New.  Reworked AI penalties on lower difficulty levels.
Reduced Schemer leader orders per war from 2 to 1
Garrison getting pillaged no longer removes existing governor
Autonomous rule now repairs damaged cities that cannot passively heal completely in a turn, even if it's currently building something else
Reduced Desert mapscript size to be in line with other maps 
Collateral damage (pierce, splash etc) formula simplified. This now does the percentage of the damage of a direct attack to the same unit, rounded up.  This change increases collateral damage dealt in some circumstances.
In the Rise of Carthage scenarios, Balearic Slingers are now buildable on the islands instead of regular Slingers. Regular Slingers can upgrade to Balearics.
Tweaked a few trait inheritance outcomes
