Test Branch 1.0.81109 Test 2025-12-10

Design

Heliopolis gives 0.5 orders per shrine instead of 1
Healing Shrines give Healer effect to both civilian and military units
Mausoleum gives Guard effect to non-promotable military units (i.e. Militia)
Mourning trait no longer has a chance to make characters ill 
If the player doesn't have enough yields to sell to cover debts, then a queued build with no progress is cleared to get enough yields to sell, if possible

UI

Traits that give yields now always show totals with Advanced Help Text enabled
Orders history graph no longer subtracts unit consumption
