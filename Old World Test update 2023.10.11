Test Branch: 1.0.69069 Test 10/11/2023

Design
  Zealot leader generals have a new action 'Apply Enlist', which gives their next kill a 100% chance to Enlist for 3 turns, for the cost of 600 civcs.  This replaces their previous 10% to enlist on kill.
  Reworked regencies. Regents no longer lead to legitimacy decay as normal leader changes do.  The rightful heir will automatically become the Chosen Heir and this cannot be changed by the Regent. 
  The free Garrison in your Capital and Fair from a Traders seat can now appear on any valid tile instead of only on existing urban tiles.  As before, the locations of these can be set by using improvement pings.
  Exiting a cloud game mid turn will now save your progress and no longer reset to the start of the turn on reload
  Urban tiles no longer placed under tribal settlements unless they are city sites (applies when City Sites number is modified)
  Pharaohs of the Nile campaign - No leader turns family opinion penalty no longer applies
  Pharaohs of the Nile scenario 3 - Reduced raids and increased Amun units on higher difficulties
  Pharaohs of the Nile scenario 6 - Climate change induced Nile flooding now has a 10 turn grace period
  Tweaked CITIES_FOREIGN ambition tiers
  Sacred and Profane - Make Clergy mission requires target to be single
  Enabled Extreme Terrain and Tribal Lands map options for multiplayer Continent and Donut map scripts and Tribe Number map option for multiplayer Seaside and Bay map scripts

  AI now waits until it has a greater power ratio before launching an attack outside of its borders 
  Clarified the distinction between a tribe city site, a tribe settlement tile, and a tribe site, which are all technically different things but in many cases the same

  Schemer's Adopt Child mission now visible on the leader
  Character event log now puts all events of the same year on the same line, to save some vertical space
