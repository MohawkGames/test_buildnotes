Test Branch: 1.0.68357 Test 08/23/2023

Design
  New map option City Site Number that limits the number of city sites available based on the number of nations.  Options are Unrestricted (default), Restricted (3 city sites per family per nation), Family Seats (1 city site per family per nation) and Capitals (1 city site per nation).   Tribal settlements will still appear in places that would have been city sites but these cannot be settled by nations.
  Tribe units now occupy empty settlements, when given the chance
  Game of the Week games now much less likely to have non-default city spacing
  Egypt now has -20% costs for same adjacent buildings (down from -25%)
  Map generator tries to place at least as many free city sites as starting locations on a given land area surrounded by water and mountains.
