Design
  Wonder rebalancing:
    Ishtar Gate: increased growth per culture level in the city from 1 to 2
    Necropolis: Now gives all cities 3 civics per pagan religion instead of 2 happiness per temple
    Royal Library: increased science output from connection to other teams, but reduced output from own team
    Al Khazneh: Now gives free silk, perfume, ebony, porcelain, and furs, and a Caravan every 5 turns.  Removed money bonus and 3 instant Caravans
    Mausoleum: increased culture modifier from 40% to 50%
    Hagia Sophia: Now gives 2 happiness levels for every city on completion and 2 happiness per turn per culture level in the wonder city. Removed global happiness per turn
    Via Recta Souk: Now gives all on-map luxury resources. Replaced wonder city growth by 2 growth per culture level. Removed happiness per luxury and Caravans
    All improvements that produce units create one on the first turn they are built. Affects Holy Sites, Al Khazneh, Cothon and Colosseum
    Al Khazneh and Royal Library disabled in FFA games with two or fewer human players and no AI nations
  Added game option to ignore premade map nation starting locations
  Renamed Inland Sea map script to Mediterranean and made it the default initial map for single player games. The original Inland Sea is no longer hidden
