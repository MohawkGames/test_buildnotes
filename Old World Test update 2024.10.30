Design

Distant raids: no longer include ships
AI unit building: The traits of Grand Viziers and AI leaders now influence their decisions of how many units they build
Heroes, Commanders, Tacticians, and Warlike characters build more units and Builders, Scholars, Diplomats, and Timid characters build fewer units
AI is more likely to build units in cities that give unit promotions and experience
Alliance events: Most alliance and tribal alliance events now either require a diplomat leader or are disabled in competitive mode
City reveal: Cities are now revealed from a greater distance, like settlements
City capture: Cities now take 1 turn longer to capture
Unit spawn location: Rebels from Slums spawn on Slum tiles and Religious Dissent rebels spawn on religious buildings, if possible 
Starting units no longer spawn on the same tile, even if they are allowed to do so
