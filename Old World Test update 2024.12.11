Test Branch 1.0.75342 Test 2024-12-11

Design

Grand Vizier now acts as a governor in cities without a governor and controls production only in those cities. Removed all other Grand Vizier yields
Changes to diplomatic Declare War missions:
  Ask to Declare War mission now requires a Leader with the Schemer archetype.  Removed mission tech requirement and lowered opinion needed to Cautious
  Ask to Join War mission added, where you must already be at war with the target.  This requires Pleased opinion
  With Ruthless AI enabled, war requests will be denied if the player is close to victory
The Random Improvements option now allows any combination of shrine effects instead of picking a set from a random nation
Removed family preferences from crowning ambitions.  Most crowning ambition events now allow three choices of ambition instead of two.  Along with some bug fixes this should give a much higher variety of crowning ambitions offered
Launch Offensive can now be used from a unit with a rout cooldown and it removes rout cooldowns from adjacent units

Programming

AI builds fewer duplicate roads
Improved AI retreat vs attack decision making
Disabled implicit subject conversion for DiplomacySubjects bonuses
Hall of Fame games now store the active player so that when you load them the player stays the same

UI

Added minimize toggle to player goals/ambitions display
Inverted red/green warning text in some cases for negative yields 
User assigned hotkeys now have more flexibility.  Assignments can use previously reserved keys and conflict with non-assignable hotkeys.
