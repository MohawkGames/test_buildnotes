Test Branch: 1.0.68629 Test 08/31/2023

Design
  Revised city site placement algorithm so that you can now have player starts closer than two minimum city site distances apart, if the map is too small for the number of players
  Higher-tier wonders now count toward lower-tier goals - e.g. Legendary wonders will be counted for the "have 1 Strong wonder" goal 
  Can now hurry obsolete units already in the build queue
  End turn is canceled if there are new decisions to make after moving automated units

Programming
  Tribal invasion AI improvements
  Combat AI improvements
  Added console command setTribeInvasion
  Added mod support for specific tribes and tribe strengths to use central AI to coordinate their units
  Change mod Infos files now processed after append mod Infos files 
  Improved terrain mod support and performance optimizations
  Map scripts now use internal variable/functions to set terrain formations, without persisting them to tile data since formations are only needed at generation time
  Removed terrain formation ID and tile elevation from network data 
  Removed some unused terrain renderers
  Removed unnecessary calls for timeline border tiles
  Got rid of tile latitude in network data and saves. The save now instead stores the min/max latitude of the generating mapscript, latitudes are calculated as needed
  Optimization to avoid calls to native code in a few places

UI
  Added list of past events to character tooltip 
  Added toggle to tutorial events to allow the tutorial to be disabled directly from the event
  Improved urban adjacency requirement help text
  Tooltips for Barracks, Harbors etc now say they are a spawn point for relevant units
  Removed city site text on tiles with settlements on them.  Tile tooltip now shows if tile is a city site.
  Map editor UI cleanup
  Added progress for "Establish a State Religion" ambition
  Hurry helptext now shows warning if cannot hurry due to missing prereq, such as Scholar governor for Inquiry 
  Event browser added new event warnings
  Added strategy notes to Encyclopedia entries for Laws
